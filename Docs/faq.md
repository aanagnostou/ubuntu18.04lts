###### How to change the PHP version youâ€™re using

  If you have multiple PHP versions installed on your Ubuntu server, you can change what version is the default one.

  To set PHP 7.0 as the default, run:
    ```
    $ update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php7.0
    ```
  To set PHP 7.2 as the default, run:
    ```
    $ update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php7.2
    ```
  
  If you have installed Apache 2.4, you can configure Apache to use PHP 7.2 with the following command:
    ```
    $ a2enmod php7.2
    ```
  
  And then restart Apache for the changes to take effect:
    ```
    systemctl restart apache2
    ```
